The purpose of this repository is to call out terrible recruiters and companies with terrible recruitment practices in the tech industry.

All reviews will be organized as follows:

    -- Tech Companies
      -- [Company Name]
        -- [Recruiter Name].md
    -- Recruitment Agencies
      -- [Company Name]
        -- [Recruiter Name].md
```

Seperate entries will be created for [Country], [Company Name] and [Recruiter Name]

Please describe your experiences in separate paragraphs inside the [Recruiter Name].md file. If you like to share your experiences anonymously, feel free to send them through an email to RecruiterBlackList@gmail.com. 

Any personal attackson recruiters will not be tolerated. All reviews must strictly be related to the professional interaction between you and recruiters.
